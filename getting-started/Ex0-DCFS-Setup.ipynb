    "## SENTINEL Hub / xcube Integration Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the Notebooks in this folder, you will need some of your [SENTINEL Hub credentials](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/#/API/authentication) and a Python environment\n",
    "with [`xcube`](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube) and the `xcube` plugin [`xcube_sh`](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-sh) installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "For creating an `xcube` Python environment and installing `xcube` follow the instructions given in the [xcube's README](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube/blob/master/README.md).\n",
    "For installing the `xcube_sh` plugin follow the instructions given in the [xcube-sh's README](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-sh/blob/master/README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using Jupyter Lab for the first time install the `jupyterlab` package and make sure the \n",
    "[Jupyter GeoJSON extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jupyterlab/geojson-extension) is installed too:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "(xcube) jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/geojson-extension\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication / Authorisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your SENTINEL Hub (SH) API credentials may be passed by environment variables: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(xcube) $ export SH_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>\n",
    "(xcube) $ export SH_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>\n",
    "(xcube) $ export SH_INSTANCE_ID=<your-ogc-instance-id>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter `SH_INSTANCE_ID` is your SH OGC instance ID and is required to allow submitting SH WFS requests which again are used to determine time stamps with valid observations for the given region.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass the SH credentials to the `xcube_sh.cube.open_cube()` function as keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sh_credentials = dict(client_id='<your-id>',\n",
    "                      client_secret='<your-client-secret>',\n",
    "                      instance_id='<your-ogc-instance-id>')\n",
